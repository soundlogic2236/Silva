HAMTHESMOL
The Ballad of Hamther
<END PAGE>
1. Great the evils |
once that grew,
With the dawning sad |
of the sorrow of
elves;
In early mom | awake
for men
The evils that grief | to
each shall bring.

<END PAGE>
2. Not now, nor yet | of
yesterday was it,
Long the time | that
since hath lapsed,
So that little there is |
that is half as old,
Since Guthrun,
daughter | of Gjuki,
whetted
Her sons so young | to
Svanhild's vengeance.
<END PAGE>
3. "The sister ye had |
was Svanhild called,
And her did Jormunrek
| trample with horses,
White and black | on the
battle-way,
Gray, road-wonted, |
the steeds of the
Goths.

<END PAGE>
4. "Little the kings | of
the folk are ye like,
For now ye are living |
alone of my race.

5. "Lonely am I | as the
forest aspen,
Of kindred bare | as
the fir of its boughs,
My joys are all lost |
as the leaves of the
tree
<END PAGE>
When the scather of
twigs | from the warm
day turns."

6. Then Hamther spake
forth, | the high of
heart:
Small praise didst thou,
Guthrun, | to Hogni's
deed give
When they wakened thy
Sigurth | from out of
his sleep,
<END PAGE>
Thou didst sit on the
bed | while his slayers
laughed.

7. Thy bed-covers
white | with blood were
red
From his wounds, and
with gore | of thy
husband were wet;
So Sigurth was slain, |
by his corpse didst
thou sit,
<END PAGE>
And of gladness didst
think not: | 'twas
Gunnar's doing.

8. "Thou wouldst strike
at Atli | by the slaying
of Erp
And the killing of Eitil; |
thine own grief was
worse;
So should each one
wield | the wound-biting
sword
<END PAGE>
That another it slays |
but smites not himself."

9. Then did Sorli speak
out, | for wise was he
ever:
With my mother I never
| a quarrel will make;
Full little in speaking |
methinks ye both lack;
What askest thou,
Guthrun, | that will give
thee no tears?
<END PAGE>
10. For thy brothers
dost weep, | and thy
boys so sweet,
Thy kinsmen in birth |
on the battlefield slain;
Now, Guthrun, as; well |
for us both shalt thou
weep,
We sit doomed on our
steeds, | and far
hence shall we die."
<END PAGE>
11. Then the fame-glad
one-- | on the steps
she was--

The slender-fingered, |
spake with her son:
Ye shall danger have |
if counsel ye heed not;
By two heroes alone |
shall two hundred of
Goths
<END PAGE>
Be bound or be slain |
in the lofty-walled
burg.

12. From the courtyard
they fared, | and fury
they breathed;
The youths swiftly went
| o'er the mountain wet,
On their Hunnish
steeds, | death's
vengeance to have.
<END PAGE>
13. On the way they
found | the man so
wise;
. . . . . . . . . .
What help from the
weakling | brown may we
have?

14. So answered them |
their half-brother
then:
<END PAGE>
So well may I | my
kinsmen aid
As help one foot | from
the other has.

15. "How may afoot | its
fellow aid,
Or a flesh-grown hand
| another help?"

<END PAGE>
16. Then Erp spake
forth, | his words were
few,
As haughty he sat | on
his horse's back:
To the timid 'tis ill | the
way to tell.
A bastard they | the
bold one called.

<END PAGE>
17. From their sheaths
they drew | their
shining swords,
Their blades, to the
giantess | joy to give;
By a third they
lessened | the might
that was theirs,
The fighter young | to
earth they felled.

<END PAGE>
18. Their cloaks they
shook, | their swords
they sheathed,
The high-born men |
wrapped their mantles
close.

19. On their road they
fared | and an ill way
found,
And their sister's son |
on a tree they saw,
<END PAGE>
On the wind-cold
wolf-tree | west of the
hall,
And cranes'-bait
crawled; | none would
care to linger.

20. In the hall was din, |
the men drank deep,
And the horses' hoofs
| could no one hear,
<END PAGE>
Till the warrior hardy |
sounded his horn.

21. Men came and the
tale | to Jormunrek
told
How warriors helmed |
without they beheld:
Take counsel wise, |
for brave ones are
come,
<END PAGE>
Of mighty men | thou
the sister didst
murder.

22. Then Jormunrek
laughed, | his hand laid
on his beard,
His arms, for with wine |
he was warlike, he
called for;
He shook his brown
locks, | on his white
shield he looked,
<END PAGE>
And raised high the
cup | of gold in his
hand.

23. "Happy, methinks, |
were I to behold
Hamther and Sorli |
here in my hall;
The men would I bind |
with strings of bows,
And Gjuki's heirs | on
the gallows hang."
<END PAGE>
24. In the hall was
clamor, | the cups were
shattered,
Men stood in blood |
from the breasts of
the Goths,

25. Then did Hamther
speak forth, | the
haughty of heart:
Thou soughtest,
Jormunrek, | us to see,
<END PAGE>
Sons of one mother |
seeking thy dwelling;
Thou seest thy hands, |
thy feet thou
beholdest,
Jormunrek, flung | in
the fire so hot.

26. Then roared the
king, | of the race of
the gods,
<END PAGE>
Bold in his armor, | as
roars a bear:
Stone ye the men | that
steel will bite not,
Sword nor spear, | the
sons of Jonak.

Sorli spake:
27. "Ill didst win,
brother, | when the bag
thou didst open,
<END PAGE>
Oft from that bag |
came baleful counsel;
Heart hast thou,
Hamther, | if knowledge
thou hadst!
A man without wisdom |
is lacking in much."

Hamther spake:
28. "His head were now
off | if Erp were living,
<END PAGE>
The brother so keen |
whom we killed on our
road,
The warrior noble,-- |
'twas the Norns that
drove me
The hero to slay | who
in fight should be holy.

<END PAGE>
29. "In fashion of
wolves | it befits us not
Amongst ourselves to
strive,
Like the hounds of the
Norns, | that nourished
were
In greed mid wastes so
grim.

<END PAGE>
30. "We have greatly
fought, | o'er the Goths
do we stand
By our blades laid low,
| like eagles on
branches;
Great our fame though
we die | today or
tomorrow;
None outlives the night
| when the Norris have
spoken."
