RIGSTHULA
The Song of Rig
<END PAGE>
1. Men say there went |
by ways so green
Of old the god, | the
aged and wise,
Mighty and strong | did
Rig go striding.
. . . . . . . . . .

2. Forward he went | on
the midmost way,
He came to a dwelling, |
a door on its posts;
<END PAGE>
In did he fare, | on the
floor was a fire,
Two hoary ones | by
the hearth there sat,
Ai and Edda, | in olden
dress.

3. Rig knew well | wise
words to speak,
Soon in the midst | of
the room he sat,
<END PAGE>
And on either side | the
others were.

4. A loaf of bread | did
Edda bring,
Heavy and thick | and
swollen with husks;
Forth on the table |
she set the fare,
And broth for the meal
| in a bowl there was.
<END PAGE>
(Calf's flesh boiled |
was the best of the
dainties.)

5. Rig knew well | wise
words to speak,
Thence did he rise, |
made ready to sleep;
Soon in the bed |
himself did he lay,
And on either side | the
others were.
<END PAGE>
6. Thus was he there |
for three nights long,
Then forward he went |
on the midmost way,
And so nine months |
were soon passed by.

7. A son bore Edda, |
with water they
sprinkled him,
With a cloth his hair |
so black they covered;
<END PAGE>
Thræll they named him, |
. . . . .

8. The skin was
wrinkled | and rough on
his hands,
Knotted his knuckles, | .
. . . .
Thick his fingers, | and
ugly his face,
Twisted his back, | and
big his heels.
<END PAGE>
9. He began to grow, |
and to gain in strength,
Soon of his might |
good use he made;
With bast he bound, |
and burdens carried,
Home bore faggots |
the whole day long.

<END PAGE>
10. One came to their
home, | crooked her
legs,
Stained were her feet,
| and sunburned her
arms,
Flat was her nose; |
her name was Thir.

<END PAGE>
11. Soon in the midst |
of the room she sat,
By her side there sat |
the son of the house;
They whispered both, |
and the bed made
ready,
Thræll and Thir, | till
the day was through.

<END PAGE>
12. Children they had, |
they lived and were
happy,
Fjosnir and Klur | they
were called, methinks,
Hreim and Kleggi, |
Kefsir, Fulnir,
Drumb, Digraldi, | Drott
and Leggjaldi,
Lut and Hosvir; | the
house they cared for,
<END PAGE>
Ground they dunged, |
and swine they
guarded,
Goats they tended, |
and turf they dug.

13. Daughters had
they, | Drumba and
Kumba,
Ökkvinkalfa, | Arinnefla,
Ysja and Ambott, |
Eikintjasna,
<END PAGE>
Totrughypja | and
Tronubeina;
And thence has risen |
the race of thralls.

14. Forward went Rig, |
his road was straight,
To a hall he came, | and
a door there hung;
In did he fare, | on the
floor was a fire:
<END PAGE>
Afi and Amma | owned
the house.

15. There sat the twain,
| and worked at their
tasks:
The man hewed wood |
for the weaver's beam;
His beard was trimmed, |
o'er his brow a curl,
His clothes fitted
close; | in the corner a
chest.
<END PAGE>
16. The woman sat | and
the distaff wielded,
At the weaving with
arms | outstretched
she worked;
On her head was a
band, | on her breast a
smock;
On her shoulders a
kerchief | with clasps
there was.
<END PAGE>
17. Rig knew well | wise
words to speak,
Soon in the midst | of
the room he sat,
And on either side | the
others were.

18. Then took Amma | . .
. . .
The vessels full | with
the fare she set,
<END PAGE>
Calf's flesh boiled |
was the best of the
dainties.

19. Rig knew well | wise
words to speak,
He rose from the
board, | made ready to
sleep;
Soon in the bed |
himself did he lay,
<END PAGE>
And on either side | the
others were.

20. Thus was he there |
for three nights long,
Then forward he went |
on the midmost way,
And so nine months |
were soon passed by.

<END PAGE>
21. A son bore Amma, |
with water they
sprinkled him,
Karl they named him; |
in a cloth she wrapped
him,
He was ruddy of face, |
and flashing his eyes.

<END PAGE>
22. He began to grow, |
and to gain in strength,
Oxen he ruled, | and
plows made ready,
Houses he built, | and
barns he fashioned,
Carts he made, | and
the plow he managed.

<END PAGE>
23. Home did they bring
| the bride for Karl,
In goatskins clad, | and
keys she bore;
Snör was her name, |
'neath the veil she sat;
A home they made
ready, | and rings
exchanged,
The bed they decked, |
and a dwelling made.
<END PAGE>
24. Sons they had, |
they lived and were
happy:
Hal and Dreng, | Holth,
Thegn and Smith,
Breith and Bondi, |
Bundinskeggi,
Bui and Boddi, |
Brattskegg and Segg.

<END PAGE>
25. Daughters they
had, | and their names
are here:
Snot, Bruth, Svanni, |
Svarri, Sprakki,
Fljoth, Sprund and Vif,
| Feima, Ristil:
And thence has risen |
the yeomen's race.

<END PAGE>
26. Thence went Rig, |
his road was straight,
A hall he saw, | the
doors faced south;
The portal stood wide, |
on the posts was a
ring,
Then in he fared; | the
floor was strewn.

<END PAGE>
27. Within two gazed | in
each other's eyes,
Fathir and Mothir, | and
played with their
fingers;
There sat the
house-lord, | wound
strings for the bow,
Shafts he fashioned, |
and bows he shaped.

<END PAGE>
28. The lady sat, | at
her arms she looked,
She smoothed the
cloth, | and fitted the
sleeves;
Gay was her cap, | on
her breast were
clasps,
Broad was her train, |
of blue was her gown,
Her brows were bright,
| her breast was
shining,
<END PAGE>
Whiter her neck | than
new-fallen snow.

29. Rig knew | well wise
words to speak,
Soon in the midst | of
the room he sat,
And on either side | the
others were.

<END PAGE>
30. Then Mothir
brought | a broidered
cloth,
Of linen bright, | and
the board she
covered;
And then she took | the
loaves so thin,
And laid them, white |
from the wheat, on the
cloth.
<END PAGE>
31. Then forth she
brought | the vessels
full,
With silver covered, |
and set before them,
Meat all browned, | and
well-cooked birds;
In the pitcher was wine,
| of plate were the
cups,
So drank they and
talked | till the day was
gone.
<END PAGE>
32. Rig knew well | wise
words to speak,
Soon did he rise, | made
ready to sleep;
So in the bed | himself
did he lay,
And on either side | the
others were.

<END PAGE>
33. Thus was he there |
for three nights long,
Then forward he went |
on the midmost way,
And so nine months |
were soon passed by.

34. A son had Mothir, |
in silk they wrapped
him,
With water they
sprinkled him, | Jarl he
was;
<END PAGE>
Blond was his hair, |
and bright his cheeks,
Grim as a snake's |
were his glowing eyes.

35. To grow in the
house | did Jarl begin,
Shields he brandished,
| and bow-strings
wound,
Bows he shot, | and
shafts he fashioned,
<END PAGE>
Arrows he loosened, |
and lances wielded,
Horses he rode, | and
hounds unleashed,
Swords he handled, |
and sounds he swam.

36. Straight from the
grove | came striding
Rig,
Rig came striding, | and
runes he taught him;
<END PAGE>
By his name he called
him, | as son he claimed
him,
And bade him hold | his
heritage wide,
His heritage wide, | the
ancient homes.

37. . . . . . . . . . .
Forward he rode |
through the forest
dark,
<END PAGE>
O'er the frosty crags,
| till a hall he found.

38. His spear he shook,
| his shield he
brandished,
His horse he spurred, |
with his sword he
hewed;
Wars he raised, | and
reddened the field,
<END PAGE>
Warriors slew he, | and
land he won.

39. Eighteen halls | ere
long did he hold,
Wealth did he get, | and
gave to all,
Stones and jewels |
and slim-flanked
steeds,
Rings he offered, | and
arm-rings shared.
<END PAGE>
40. His messengers
went | by the ways so
wet,
And came to the hall |
where Hersir dwelt;
His daughter was fair |
and slender-fingered,
Erna the wise | the
maiden was.

<END PAGE>
41. Her hand they
sought, | and home they
brought her,
Wedded to Jarl | the
veil she wore;
Together they dwelt, |
their joy was great,
Children they had, |
and happy they lived.

<END PAGE>
42. Bur was the eldest,
| and Barn the next,
Joth and Athal, | Arfi,
Mog,
Nith and Svein, | soon
they began-
Sun and Nithjung-- | to
play and swim;
Kund was one, | and the
youngest Kon.

<END PAGE>
43. Soon grew up | the
sons of Jarl,
Beasts they tamed, |
and bucklers rounded,
Shafts they fashioned,
| and spears they
shook.

44. But Kon the Young |
learned runes to use,
Runes everlasting, |
the runes of life;
<END PAGE>
Soon could he well |
the warriors shield,
Dull the swordblade, |
and still the seas.

45. Bird-chatter
learned he, | flames
could he lessen.,
Minds could quiet, | and
sorrows calm;
. . . . . . . . . .
<END PAGE>
The might and strength
| of twice four men.

46. With Rig-Jarl soon |
the runes he shared,
More crafty he was, |
and greater his wisdom;
The right he sought, |
and soon he won it,
Rig to be called, | and
runes to know.
<END PAGE>
47. Young Kon rode
forth | through forest
and grove,
Shafts let loose, | and
birds he lured;

There spake a crow |
on a bough that sat:
Why lurest thou, Kon, |
the birds to come?

<END PAGE>
48.  'Twere better
forth | on thy steed to
fare,
. . . . . | and the host to
slay.

49. "The halls of Dan |
and Danp are noble,
Greater their wealth |
than thou bast gained;
Good are they | at
guiding the keel,
