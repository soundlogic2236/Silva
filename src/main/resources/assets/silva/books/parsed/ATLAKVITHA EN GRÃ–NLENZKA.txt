ATLAKVITHA EN GRÖNLENZKA
The Greenland Lay of Atli
<END PAGE>
1. Atli sent | of old to
Gunnar
A keen-witted rider, |
Knefröth did men call
him;
To Gjuki's home came
<END PAGE>
he | and to Gunnar's
dwelling,
With benches round the
hearth, | and to the
beer so sweet.

<END PAGE>
2. Then the followers,
hiding | their falseness,
all drank
Their wine in the
war-hall, | of the Huns'
<END PAGE>
wrath wary;
And Knefröth spake
loudly, | his words were
crafty,
The hero from the
<END PAGE>
south, | on the high
bench sitting:

3. "Now Atli has sent me
| his errand to ride,
On my bit-champing
<END PAGE>
steed | through
Myrkwood the secret,
To bid You, Gunnar, | to
his benches to come,
With helms round the
hearth, | and Atli's
<END PAGE>
home seek.

4. "Shields shall ye
choose there, | and
shafts made of
ash-wood,
<END PAGE>
Gold-adorned helmets, |
and slaves out of
Hunland,
Silver-gilt
saddle-cloths, | shirts
<END PAGE>
of bright scarlet,
With lances and spears
too, | and bit-champing
steeds.

<END PAGE>
5. "The field shall be
given you | of wide
Gnitaheith,
With loud-ringing
lances, | and stems
<END PAGE>
gold-o'er-laid,
Treasures full huge, |
and the home of Danp,
And the mighty forest |
that Myrkwood is
called."
<END PAGE>
6. His head turned
Gunnar, | and to Hogni
he said:
What thy counsel,
young hero, | when
<END PAGE>
such things we hear?
No gold do I know | on
Gnitaheith lying
So fair that other | its
equal we have not.

<END PAGE>
7. We have seven halls,
| each of swords is
full,
(And all of gold | is the
hilt of each;)
My steed is the
<END PAGE>
swiftest, | my sword is
sharpest,
My bows adorn
benches, | my byrnies
are golden,
My helm is the
<END PAGE>
brightest | that came
from Kjar's hall,
(Mine own is better |
than all the Huns'
treasure.)"

<END PAGE>
Hogni spake:
8. "What seeks she to
say, | that she sends
us a ring,
Woven with a wolf's
<END PAGE>
hair? | methinks it gives
warning;
In the red ring a hair |
of the heath-dweller
found I,
Wolf-like shall our
<END PAGE>
road be | if we ride on
this journey."

9. Not eager were his
comrades, | nor the
men of his kin,
The wise nor the wary,
<END PAGE>
| nor the warriors
bold.
But Gunnar spake
forth | as befitted a
king,
Noble in the beer-hall,
<END PAGE>
| and bitter his scorn:

10. "Stand forth now,
Fjornir! | and hither on
the floor
The beakers all golden
<END PAGE>
| shalt thou bring to
the warriors.
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .

11. "The wolves then
<END PAGE>
shall rule | the wealth
of the Niflungs,
Wolves aged and
grey-hued, | if Gunnar
is lost,
And black-coated
<END PAGE>
bears | with rending
teeth bite,
And make glad the
dogs, | if Gunnar
returns not."

<END PAGE>
12. A following gallant |
fared forth with the
ruler,
Yet they wept as their
home | with the hero
<END PAGE>
they left;
And the little heir | of
Hogni called loudly:
Go safe now, ye wise
ones, | wherever ye
will!
<END PAGE>
13. Then let the bold
heroes | their
bit-champing horses
On the mountains
gallop, | and through
<END PAGE>
Myrkwood the secret;
All Hunland was shaken
| where the
hard-souled ones
rode,
On the whip-fearers
<END PAGE>
fared they | through
fields that were green.

14. Then they saw Atli's
halls, | and his
watch-towers high,
On the walls so lofty |
<END PAGE>
stood the warriors of
Buthli;
The hall of the
southrons | with seats
was surrounded,
With targets bound |
<END PAGE>
and shields full bright.

15. Mid weapons and
lances | did Atli his wine
In the war-hall drink, |
<END PAGE>
without were his
watchmen,
For Gunnar they
waited, | if forth he
should go,
With their ringing
<END PAGE>
spears | they would
fight with the ruler.

16. This their sister
saw, | as soon as her
brothers
Had entered the hall,--
<END PAGE>
| little ale had she
drunk:
Betrayed art thou,
Gunnar! | what guard
hast thou, hero,
Gainst the plots of the
<END PAGE>
Huns? | from the hall
flee swiftly!

17. Brother, 'twere far
better | to have come
in byrnie,
With thy household
<END PAGE>
helmed, | to see Atli's
home,
And to sit in the saddle
| all day 'neath the
sun,
(That the sword-norns
<END PAGE>
might weep | for the
death-pale warriors,
And the Hunnish
shield-maids | might
shun not the sword,)
And send Atli himself |
<END PAGE>
to the den of the
snakes;
(Now the den of the
snakes | for thee is
destined.

<END PAGE>
Gunnar spake:
18. . . . . . . . . . .
Too late is it, sister, |
to summon the Niflungs,
Long is it to come | to
<END PAGE>
the throng of our
comrades,
The heroes gallant, |
from the hills of the
Rhine.
* * * * * *

<END PAGE>
19. Then Gunnar they
seized, | and they set
him in chains,
The Burgundians' king, |
and fast they bound
<END PAGE>
him.

20. Hogni slew seven |
with sword so keen,
And an eighth he flung
| in the fire hot;
<END PAGE>
A hero should fight |
with his foemen thus,
As Hogni strove | in
Gunnar's behalf.

<END PAGE>
21. . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
The leader they asked
| if his life he fain
With gold would buy, |
<END PAGE>
the king of the Goths.

Gunnar spake:
22. "First the heart of
Hogni | shall ye lay in
my hands,
<END PAGE>
All bloody from the
breast | of the bold
one cut
With ke-en-biting
sword, | from the son
<END PAGE>
of the king."

23. . . . . . . . . . .
They cut out the heart
| from the breast of
Hjalli,
<END PAGE>
On a platter they bore
it, | and brought it to
Gunnar.

24. Then Gunnar spake
<END PAGE>
forth, | the lord of the
folk:
Here have I the heart |
of Hjalli the craven,
Unlike to the heart | of
Hogni the valiant,
For it trembles still |
<END PAGE>
as it stands on the
platter;
Twice more did it
tremble | in the breast
of the man.

<END PAGE>
25. Then Hogni laughed
| when they cut out the
heart
Of the living
helm-hammerer; | tears
<END PAGE>
he had not.
. . . . . . . . . .
On a platter they bore
it, | and brought it to
Gunnar.

<END PAGE>
26. Then Gunnar spake
forth, | the spear of
the Niflungs:
Here have I the heart |
of Hogni the valiant,
Unlike to the heart | of
<END PAGE>
Hjalli the craven,
Little it trembles | as it
lies on the platter,
Still less did it tremble |
when it lay in his
breast.
<END PAGE>
27. "So distant, Atli, |
from all men's eyes,
Shalt thou be as thou |
. . . . . from the gold.
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
<END PAGE>
28. "To no one save me
| is the secret known
Of the Niflungs' hoard,
| now Hogni is dead;
Of old there were two, |
<END PAGE>
while we twain were
alive,
Now is none but I, | for
I only am living.

29. "The swift Rhine
<END PAGE>
shall hold | the
strife-gold of heroes,
That once was the
gods', | the wealth of
the Niflungs,
In the depths of the
<END PAGE>
waters | the
death-rings shall
glitter,
And not shine on the
hands | of the Hunnish
men."

<END PAGE>
Atli spake:
30. "Ye shall bring the
wagon, | for now is he
bound."
* * * * * *

<END PAGE>
31. On the long-maned
Glaum | rode Atli the
great,
About him were
warriors | . . . . .
But Guthrun, akin | to
<END PAGE>
the gods of slaughter,
Yielded not to her
tears | in the hall of
tumult.

<END PAGE>
Guthrun spake:
32. "It shall go with
thee, Atli, | as with
Gunnar thou heldest
The oaths ofttimes
<END PAGE>
sworn, | and of old
made firm,
By the sun in the
south, | by Sigtyr's
mountain,
By the horse of the
<END PAGE>
rest-bed, | and the
ring of Ull."

33. Then the champer
of bits | drew the
chieftain great,
The gold-guarder,
<END PAGE>
down | to the place of
death.
. . . . . . . . . .

34. By the warriors'
host | was the living
<END PAGE>
hero
Cast in the den | where
crawling about
Within were serpents, |
but soon did Gunnar
With his hand in wrath |
<END PAGE>
on the harp-strings
smite;
The strings
resounded,-- | so shall
a hero,
A ring-breaker, gold |
<END PAGE>
from his enemies
guard.

35. Then Atli rode | on
his earth-treading
steed,
Seeking his home, | from
<END PAGE>
the slaughter-place;
There was clatter of
hoofs | of the steeds
in the court,
And the clashing of
<END PAGE>
arms | as they came
from the field.

36. Out then came
Guthrun | to meeting
with Atli,
With a golden beaker |
<END PAGE>
as gift to the monarch:
Thou mayst eat now,
chieftain, | within thy
dwelling,
Blithely with Guthrun |
<END PAGE>
young beasts fresh
slaughtered.

37. The wine-heavy
ale-cups | of Atli
resounded,
When there in the hall |
<END PAGE>
the Hunnish youths
clamored,
And the warriors
bearded, | the brave
ones, entered.

<END PAGE>
38. Then in came the
shining one, | . . . . .
. . . . . | and drink she
bore them;
Unwilling and bitter |
<END PAGE>
brought she food to
the warrior,
Till in scorn to the
white-faced | Atli did
she speak:

<END PAGE>
39. "Thou giver of
swords, | of thy sons
the hearts
All heavy with blood | in
honey thou hast eaten;
Thou shalt stomach,
<END PAGE>
thou hero, | the flesh
of the slain,
To eat at thy feast, |
and to send to thy
followers.

<END PAGE>
40. "Thou shalt never
call | to thy knees
again
Erp or Eitil, | when
merry with ale;
Thou shalt never see |
<END PAGE>
in their seats again
The sharers of gold |
their lances shaping,
(Clipping the manes | or
minding their steeds.)"

<END PAGE>
41. There was clamor
on the benches, | and
the cry of men,
The clashing of
weapons, | and weeping
<END PAGE>
of the Huns,
Save for Guthrun only,
| she wept not ever
For her bear-fierce
brothers, | or the boys
so dear,
<END PAGE>
So young and so
unhappy, | whom with
Atli she had.

42. Gold did she
<END PAGE>
scatter, | the
swan-white one,
And rings of red gold |
to the followers gave
she;
The fate she let grow, |
<END PAGE>
and the shining wealth
go,
Nor spared she the
treasure | of the
temple itself.

<END PAGE>
43. Unwise then was
Atli, | he had drunk to
wildness,
No weapon did he have,
| and of Guthrun
<END PAGE>
bewared not;
Oft their play was
better | when both in
gladness
Each other embraced |
among princes all.
<END PAGE>
44. With her sword she
gave blood | for the
bed to drink,
With her death-dealing
hand, | and the hounds
<END PAGE>
she loosed,
The thralls she
awakened, | and a
firebrand threw
In the door of the hall;
<END PAGE>
| so vengeance she
had.

45. To the flames she
gave all | who yet were
within,
And from Myrkheim had
<END PAGE>
come | from the murder
of Gunnar;
The timbers old fell, |
the temple was in
flames,
The dwelling of the
<END PAGE>
Buthlungs, | and the
shield-maids burned,
They were slain in the
house, | in the hot
flames they sank.

<END PAGE>
46. Now the tale is all
told, | nor in later time
Will a woman in byrnie |
avenge so her
brothers;
The fair one to three |
<END PAGE>
of the kings of the folk
Brought the doom of
death | ere herself
she died.
Still more is told in the
<END PAGE>
