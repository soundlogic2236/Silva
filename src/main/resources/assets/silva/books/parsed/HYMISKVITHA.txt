HYMISKVITHA
The Lay of Hymir
<END PAGE>
1. Of old the gods |
made feast together,
And drink they sought |
ere sated they were;
Twigs they shook, | and
blood they tried:
Rich fare in Ægir's |
hall they found.

<END PAGE>
2. The mountain-dweller
| sat merry as
boyhood,
But soon like a blinded
| man he seemed;
The son of Ygg | gazed
in his eyes:
For the gods a feast |
shalt thou forthwith
get.

<END PAGE>
3. The word-wielder toil
| for the giant worked,
And so revenge | on
the gods he sought;
He bade Sif's mate | the
kettle bring:
Therein for ye all |
much ale shall I brew.

<END PAGE>
4. The far-famed ones
| could find it not,
And the holy gods |
could get it nowhere;
Till in truthful wise | did
Tyr speak forth,
And helpful counsel |
to Hlorrithi gave.

<END PAGE>
5. "There dwells to the
east | of Elivagar
Hymir the wise | at the
end of heaven;
A kettle my father |
fierce doth own,
A mighty vessel | a mile
in depth."

<END PAGE>
Thor spake:
6. "May we win, dost
thou think, | this whirler
of water?"

Tyr spake:
Aye, friend, we can, | if
cunning we are.

<END PAGE>
7. Forward that day |
with speed they fared,
From Asgarth came
they | to Egil's home;
The goats with horns |
bedecked he guarded;
Then they sped to the
hall | where Hymir
dwelt.

<END PAGE>
8. The youth found his
grandam, | that greatly
he loathed,
And full nine hundred |
heads she had;
But the other fair |
with gold came forth,
And the bright-browed
one | brought beer to
her son.

<END PAGE>
9. "Kinsman of giants, |
beneath the kettle
Will I set ye both, | ye
heroes bold;
For many a time | my
dear-loved mate
To guests is wrathful |
and grim of mind."

<END PAGE>
10. Late to his home |
the misshapen Hymir,
The giant harsh, | from
his hunting came;
The icicles rattled | as
in he came,
For the fellow's
chin-forest | frozen
was.

<END PAGE>
11. "Hail to thee, Hymir!
| good thoughts mayst
thou have;
Here has thy son | to
thine hall now come;
(For him have we
waited, | his way was
long;)
And with him fares | the
foeman of Hroth,
The friend of mankind, |
and Veur they call him.
<END PAGE>
12. "See where under |
the gable they sit!
Behind the beam | do
they hide themselves."
The beam at the glance
| of the giant broke,
And the mighty pillar |
in pieces fell.

<END PAGE>
13. Eight fell from the
ledge, | and one alone,
The hard-hammered
kettle, | of all was
whole;
Forth came they then, |
and his foes he
sought,
The giant old, | and
held with his eyes.

<END PAGE>
14. Much sorrow his
heart | foretold when
he saw
The giantess' foeman |
come forth on the
floor;
Then of the steers |
did they bring in three;
Their flesh to boil | did
the giant bid.

<END PAGE>
15. By a head was each
| the shorter hewed,
And the beasts to the
fire | straight they
bore;
The husband of Sif, |
ere to sleep he went,
Alone two oxen | of
Hymir's ate.

<END PAGE>
16. To the comrade
hoary | of Hrungnir
then
Did Hlorrithi's meal |
full mighty seem;
Next time at eve | we
three must eat
The food we have |
{illegible}s the
hunting's spoil.

<END PAGE>
17. . . . . . . . . . .
Fain to row on the sea
| was Veur, he said,
If the giant bold |
would give him bait.

Hymir spake:
18. "Go to the herd, | if
thou hast it in mind,
Thou slayer of giants, |
thy bait to seek;
<END PAGE>
For there thou soon |
mayst find, methinks,
Bait from the oxen |
easy to get."

19. Swift to the wood |
the hero went,
Till before him an ox |
all black he found;
From the beast the
slayer | of giants
broke
<END PAGE>
The fortress high | of
his double horns.

Hymir spake:
20. "Thy works,
methinks, | are worse
by far,
Thou steerer of ships,
| than when still thou
sittest."
. . . . . . . . . .
<END PAGE>
. . . . . . . . . .

21. The lord of the
goats | bade the
ape-begotten
Farther to steer | the
steed of the rollers;
But the giant said | that
his will, forsooth,
Longer to row | was
little enough.
<END PAGE>
22. Two whales on his
hook | did the mighty
Hymir
Soon pull up | on a
single cast;
In the stern the
kinsman | of Othin sat,
And Veur with cunning |
his cast prepared.

<END PAGE>
23. The warder of men,
| the worm's destroyer,
Fixed on his hook | the
head of the ox;
There gaped at the
bait | the foe of the
gods,
The girdler of all | the
earth beneath.

<END PAGE>
24. The venomous
serpent | swiftly up
To the boat did Thor, |
the bold one, pull;
With his hammer the
loathly | hill of the hair
Of the brother of
Fenrir | he smote from
above.

<END PAGE>
25. The monsters
roared, | and the
rocks resounded,
And all the earth | so
old was shaken;
. . . . . . . . . .
Then sank the fish | in
the sea forthwith.

<END PAGE>
26. . . . . . . . . . .
Joyless as back | they
rowed was the giant;
Speechless did Hymir |
sit at the oars,
With the rudder he
sought | a second wind.

Hymir spake:
27. "The half of our
toil | wilt thou have with
me,
<END PAGE>
And now make fast |
our goat of the flood;
Or home wilt thou bear
| the whales to the
house,
Across the gorge | of
the wooded glen?"

28. Hlorrithi stood |
and the stem he
gripped,
<END PAGE>
And the sea-horse with
water | awash he lifted;
Oars and bailer | and
all he bore
With the surf-swine
home | to the giant's
house.

29. His might the giant |
again would match,
For stubborn he was, |
with the strength of
Thor;
<END PAGE>
None truly strong, |
though stoutly he
rowed,
Would he call save one
| who could break the
cup.

30. Hlorrithi then, |
when the cup he held,
Struck with the glass |
the pillars of stone;
<END PAGE>
As he sat the posts | in
pieces he shattered,
Yet the glass to Hymir
whole they brought.

31. But the loved one
fair | of the giant
found
A counsel true, | and
told her thought:
Smite the skull of Hymir,
| heavy with food,
<END PAGE>
For harder it is | than
ever was glass.

32. The goats' mighty
ruler | then rose on
his knee,
And with all the
strength | of a god he
struck;
Whole was the fellow's |
helmet-stem,
<END PAGE>
But shattered the
wine-cup | rounded
was.

Hymir spake:
33. "Fair is the
treasure | that from
me is gone,
Since now the cup | on
my knees lies
shattered;"
<END PAGE>
So spake the giant: |
"No more can I say
In days to be, | 'Thou
art brewed, mine ale.'

34. "Enough shall it be
| if out ye can bring
Forth from our house |
the kettle here."
Tyr then twice | to
move it tried,
<END PAGE>
But before him the
kettle | twice stood
fast.

35. The father of Mothi
| the rim seized firm,
And before it stood |
on the floor below;
Up on his head | Sif's
husband raised it,
And about his heels |
the handles clattered.
<END PAGE>
36. Not long had they
fared, | ere backwards
looked
The son of Othin, |
once more to see;
From their caves in the
east | beheld he coming
With Hymir the throng |
of the many-headed.

<END PAGE>
37. He stood and cast |
from his back the
kettle,
And Mjollnir, the lover
| of murder, he wielded;
. . . . . . . . . .
So all the whales | of
the waste he slew.

<END PAGE>
38. Not long had they
fared | ere one there
lay
Of Hlorrithi's goats |
half-dead on the
ground;
In his leg the
pole-horse | there was
lame;
The deed the evil | Loki
had done.
<END PAGE>
39. But ye all have
heard,-- | for of them
who have
The tales of the gods, |
who better can tell?
What prize he won |
from the
wilderness-dweller,
Who both his children |
gave him to boot.
