THRYMSKVITHA
The Lay of Thrym
<END PAGE>
1. Wild was Vingthor |
when he awoke,
And when his mighty |
hammer he missed;
He shook his beard, |
his hair was bristling,
As the son of Jorth |
about him sought.

<END PAGE>
2. Hear now the speech
| that first he spake:
Harken, Loki, | and heed
my words,
Nowhere on earth | is it
known to man,
Nor in heaven above: |
our hammer is stolen.

<END PAGE>
3. To the dwelling fair |
of Freyja went they,

Hear now the speech |
that first he spake:
Wilt thou, Freyja, | thy
feather-dress lend me,
That so my hammer | I
may seek?

<END PAGE>
Freyja spake:
4. "Thine should it be |
though of silver bright,
And I would give it |
though 'twere of gold."
Then Loki flew, | and
the feather-dress
whirred,
Till he left behind him |
the home of the gods,
And reached at last |
the realm of the giants.
<END PAGE>
5. Thrym sat on a
mound, | the giants'
master,
Leashes of gold | he
laid for his dogs,
And stroked and
smoothed | the manes
of his steeds.

<END PAGE>
Thrym spake:
6. "How fare the gods, |
how fare the elves?
Why comst thou alone |
to the giants' land?"

Loki spake:
III fare the gods, | ill
fare the elves!
Hast thou hidden |
Hlorrithi's hammer?
<END PAGE>
Thrym spake:
7. "I have hidden |
Hlorrithi's hammer,
Eight miles down | deep
in the earth;
And back again | shall
no man bring it
If Freyja I win not | to
be my wife."

<END PAGE>
8. Then Loki flew, | and
the feather-dress
whirred,
Till he left behind him |
the home of the giants,
And reached at last |
the realm of the gods.
There in the courtyard
| Thor he met:

<END PAGE>
Hear now the speech |
that first he spake:
9. "Hast thou found
tidings | as well as
trouble?
Thy news in the air |
shalt thou utter now;
Oft doth the sitter | his
story forget,
And lies he speaks |
who lays himself down."
<END PAGE>
Loki spake:
I0. "Trouble I have, |
and tidings as well:
Thrym, king of the
giants, | keeps thy
hammer,
And back again | shall
no man bring it
If Freyja he wins not |
to be his wife."

<END PAGE>
11. Freyja the fair |
then went they to find

Hear now the speech |
that first he spake:
Bind on, Freyja, | the
bridal veil,
For we two must haste |
to the giants' home.

<END PAGE>
12. Wrathful was
Freyja, | and fiercely
she snorted,
And the dwelling great |
of the gods was
shaken,
And burst was the
mighty | Brisings'
necklace:
Most lustful indeed |
should I look to all
<END PAGE>
If I journeyed with
thee | to the giants'
home.

13. Then were the gods
| together met,
And the goddesses
came | and council held,
And the far-famed
ones | a plan would
find,
<END PAGE>
How they might
Hlorrithi's | hammer win.

14. Then Heimdall
spake, | whitest of the
gods,
Like the Wanes he knew
| the future well:
Bind we on Thor | the
bridal veil,
Let him bear the mighty
| Brisings' necklace;
<END PAGE>
15. Keys around him |
let there rattle,
And down to his knees |
hang woman's dress;
With gems full broad |
upon his breast,
And a pretty cap | to
crown his head."

<END PAGE>
16. Then Thor the
mighty | his answer
made:
Me would the gods |
unmanly call
If I let bind | the bridal
veil.

17. Then Loki spake, |
the son of Laufey:
Be silent, Thor, | and
speak not thus;
<END PAGE>
Else will the giants | in
Asgarth dwell
If thy hammer is
brought not | home to
thee.

8. Then bound they on
Thor | the bridal veil,
And next the mighty |
Brisings' necklace.

<END PAGE>
19. Keys around him |
let they rattle,
And down to his knees |
hung woman's dress;
With gems full broad |
upon his breast,
And a pretty cap | to
crown his head.

<END PAGE>
20. Then Loki spake, |
the son of Laufey:
As thy maid-servant
thither | I go with thee;
We two shall haste | to
the giants' home.

21. Then home the
goats | to the hall were
driven,
They wrenched at the
halters, | swift were
they to run;
<END PAGE>
The mountains burst, |
earth burned with fire,
And Othin's son |
sought Jotunheim.

22. Then loud spake
Thrym, | the giants'
leader:
Bestir ye, giants, | put
straw on the benches;
Now Freyja they bring
| to be my bride,
<END PAGE>
The daughter of
Njorth | out of Noatun.

23. Gold-horned cattle
| go to my stables,
Jet-black oxen, | the
giant's joy;
Many my gems, | and
many my jewels,
Freyja alone | did I
lack, methinks."
<END PAGE>
24. Early it was | to
evening come,
And forth was borne |
the beer for the
giants;
Thor alone ate an ox, |
and eight salmon,
All the dainties as well |
that were set for the
women;
And drank Sif's mate |
three tuns of mead.
<END PAGE>
25. Then loud spake
Thrym, | the giants'
leader:
Who ever saw bride |
more keenly bite?
I ne'er saw bride | with
a broader bite,
Nor a maiden who
drank | more mead than
this!

<END PAGE>
26. Hard by there sat |
the serving-maid wise,
So well she answered |
the giant's words:
From food has Freyja
| eight nights fasted,
So hot was her longing
| for Jotunheim.

<END PAGE>
27. Thrym looked
'neath the veil, | for he
longed to kiss,
But back he leaped |
the length of the hall:
Why are so fearful |
the eyes of Freyja?
Fire, methinks, | from
her eyes burns forth.

<END PAGE>
28. Hard by there sat |
the serving-maid wise,
So well she answered |
the giant's words:
No sleep has Freyja |
for eight nights found,
So hot was her longing
| for Jotunheim.

<END PAGE>
29. Soon came the
giant's | luckless
sister,
Who feared not to ask |
the bridal fee:
From thy hands the
rings | of red gold
take,
If thou wouldst win | my
willing love,
(My willing love | and
welcome glad.)
<END PAGE>
30: Then loud spake
Thrym, | the giants'
leader:
Bring in the hammer | to
hallow the bride;
On the maiden's knees |
let Mjollnir lie,
That us both the band |
of Vor may bless.

<END PAGE>
31. The heart in the
breast | of Hlorrithi
laughed
When the hard-souled
one | his hammer
beheld;
First Thrym, the king |
of the giants, he killed,
Then all the folk | of
the giants he felled.

<END PAGE>
32. The giant's sister |
old he slew,
She who had begged |
the bridal fee;
A stroke she got | in
the shilling's stead,
And for many rings |
the might of the
hammer.
