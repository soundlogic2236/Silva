ALVISSMOL
The Ballad of Alvis
<END PAGE>
1. "Now shall the bride
| my benches adorn,
And homeward haste
forthwith;
Eager for wedlock | to
all shall I seem,
Nor at home shall they
rob me of rest."

<END PAGE>
Thor spake:
2. "What, pray, art
thou? | Why so pale
round the nose?
By the dead hast thou
lain of late?
To a giant like | dost
thou look, methinks;
Thou wast not born
for the bride."

<END PAGE>
Alvis spake:
3. "Alvis am I, | and
under the earth
My home 'neath the
rocks I have;
With the wagon-guider |
a word do I seek,
Let the gods their
bond not break."

<END PAGE>
Thor spake:
4. "Break it shall I, |
for over the bride
Her father has
foremost right;
At home was I not |
when the promise thou
hadst,
And I give her alone of
the gods."

<END PAGE>
Alvis spake:
5. "What hero claims |
such right to hold
O'er the bride that
shines so bright?
Not many will know thee,
| thou wandering man!
Who was bought with
rings to bear thee?"

<END PAGE>
Thor spake:
6. "Vingthor, the
wanderer | wide, am I,
And I am Sithgrani's
son;
Against my will | shalt
thou get the maid,
And win the marriage
word."

<END PAGE>
Alvis spake:
7. "Thy good-will now |
shall I quickly get,
And win the marriage
word;
I long to have, | and I
would not lack,
This snow-white maid
for mine."

<END PAGE>
Thor spake:
8. "The love of the
maid | I may not keep
thee
From winning, thou
guest so wise,
If of every world |
thou canst tell me all
That now I wish to
know.

<END PAGE>
