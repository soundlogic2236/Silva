SIGURTHARKVITHA EN SKAMMA
The Short Lay of Sigurth
<END PAGE>
1. Of old did Sigurth |
Gjuki seek,
The Volsung young, | in
battles victor;
Well he trusted | the
brothers twain,
With mighty oaths |
among them sworn.

<END PAGE>
2. A maid they gave him,
| and jewels many,
Guthrun the young, |
the daughter of Gjuki;
They drank and spake |
full many a day,
Sigurth the young | and
Gjuki's sons.

<END PAGE>
3. Thereafter went
they | Brynhild to woo,
And so with them | did
Sigurth ride,
The Volsung young, | in
battle valiant,--
Himself would have had
her | if all he had
seen.

<END PAGE>
4. The southern hero |
his naked sword,
Fair-flashing, let |
between them lie;
(Nor would he come |
the maid to kiss;)
The Hunnish king | in
his arms ne'er held
The maiden he gave | to
Gjuki's sons.

<END PAGE>
5. Ill she had known
not | in all her life,
And nought of the
sorrows | of men she
knew;
Blame she had not, |
nor dreamed she
should bear it,
But cruel the fates |
that among them came.

<END PAGE>
6. By herself at the
end | of day she sat,
And in open words |
her heart she uttered:
I shall Sigurth have, |
the hero young,
E'en though within | my
arms he die.

<END PAGE>
7. The word I have
spoken; | soon shall I
rue it,
His wife is Guthrun, |
and Gunnar's am I;
Ill Norns set for me |
long desire."

8. Oft did she go | with
grieving heart
On the glacier's ice | at
even-tide,
<END PAGE>
When Guthrun then | to
her bed was gone,
And the bedclothes
Sigurth | about her
laid.

9. " (Now Gjuki's child |
to her lover goes,)
And the Hunnish king |
with his wife is happy;
Joyless I am | and
mateless ever,
<END PAGE>
Till cries from my
heavy | heart burst
forth."

10. In her wrath to
battle | she roused
herself:
Gunnar, now | thou
needs must lose
Lands of mine | and me
myself,
<END PAGE>
No joy shall I have |
with the hero ever.

11. Back shall I fare |
where first I dwelt,
Among the kin | that
come of my race,
To wait there, sleeping
| my life away,
If Sigurth's death |
thou shalt not dare,
<END PAGE>
(And best of heroes |
thou shalt not be.)

12. "The son shall fare
| with his father hence,
And let not long | the
wolf-cub live;
Lighter to pay | is the
vengeance-price
After the deed | if the
son is dead."
<END PAGE>
13. Sad was Gunnar, |
and bowed with grief,
Deep in thought | the
whole day through;
Yet from his heart | it
was ever hid
What deed most fitting |
he should find,
(Or what thing best |
for him should be,
Or if he should seek |
the Volsung to slay,
<END PAGE>
For with mighty longing
| Sigurth he loved.)

14. Much he pondered |
for many an hour;
Never before | was the
wonder known
That a queen should
thus | her kingdom
leave;
In counsel then | did
he Hogni call,
<END PAGE>
(For him in truest |
trust he held.)

15. "More than all | to
me is Brynhild,
Buthli's child, | the best
of women;
My very life | would I
sooner lose
Than yield the love | of
yonder maid.
<END PAGE>
16. "Wilt thou the hero |
for wealth betray?
Twere good to have |
the gold of the Rhine,
And all the hoard | in
peace to hold,
And waiting fortune |
thus to win."

<END PAGE>
17. Few the words | of
Hogni were:
Us it beseems not | so
to do,
To cleave with swords |
the oaths we swore,
The oaths we swore |
and all our vows.

<END PAGE>
18. We know no mightier
| men on earth
The while we four |
o'er the folk hold
sway,
And while the Hunnish |
hero lives,
Nor higher kinship | the
world doth hold.

<END PAGE>
19. "If sons we five |
shall soon beget,
Great, methinks, | our
race shall grow;
Well I see | whence
lead the ways;
Too bitter far | is
Brynhild's hate."

<END PAGE>
Gunnar spake:
20. "Gotthorm to wrath
| we needs must rouse,
Our younger brother, |
in rashness blind;
He entered not | in the
oaths we swore,
The oaths we swore |
and all our vows."

<END PAGE>
21. It was easy to
rouse | the reckless
one.
. . . . . . . . . .
The sword in the heart
| of Sigurth stood.

22. In vengeance the
hero | rose in the hall,
And hurled his sword |
at the slayer bold;
<END PAGE>
At Gotthorm flew | the
glittering steel
Of Gram full hard |
from the hand of the
king.

23. The foeman cleft |
asunder fell,
Forward hands | and
head did sink,
And legs and feet | did
backward fall.
<END PAGE>
24. Guthrun soft | in
her bed had slept,
Safe from care | at
Sigurth's side;
She woke to find | her
joy had fled,
In the blood of the
friend | of Freyr she
lay.

<END PAGE>
25. So hard she smote |
her hands together
That the hero rose up,
| iron-hearted:
Weep not, Guthrun, |
grievous tears,
Bride so young, | for
thy brothers live.

<END PAGE>
26. Too young,
methinks, | is my son as
yet,
He cannot flee | from
the home of his foes;
Fearful and deadly |
the plan they found,
The counsel new | that
now they have heeded.

<END PAGE>
27. "No son will ride, |
though seven thou
hast,
To the Thing as the
son | of their sister
rides;
Well I see | who the ill
has worked,
On Brynhild alone | lies
the blame for all.

<END PAGE>
28. "Above all men | the
maiden loved me,
Yet false to Gunnar | I
ne'er was found;
I kept the oaths | and
the kinship I swore;
Of his queen the lover
| none may call me.

<END PAGE>
29. In a swoon she
sank | when Sigurth
died;
So hard she smote |
her hands together
That all the cups | in
the cupboard rang,
And loud in the
courtyard | cried the
geese.

<END PAGE>
30. Then Brynhild,
daughter | of Buthli,
laughed,
Only once, | with all her
heart,
When as she lay | full
loud she heard
The grievous wail | of
Gjuki's daughter.

<END PAGE>
31. Then Gunnar,
monarch | of men,
spake forth:
Thou dost not laugh, |
thou lover of hate,
In gladness there, | or
for aught of good;
Why has thy face | so
white a hue,
Mother of ill? |
Foredoomed thou art.
<END PAGE>
32. A worthier woman |
wouldst thou have
been
If before thine eyes |
we had Atli slain;
If thy brother's
bleeding | body hadst
seen
And the bloody wounds
| that thou shouldst
End."
<END PAGE>
Brynhild spake:
33. "None mock thee,
Gunnar! | thou hast
mightily fought,
But thy hatred little |
doth Atli heed;
Longer than thou, |
methinks, shall he live,
And greater in might |
shall he ever remain.

<END PAGE>
34. "To thee I say, |
and thyself thou
knowest,
That all these ills |
thou didst early shape;
No bonds I knew, | nor
sorrow bore,
And wealth I had | in my
brother's home.

<END PAGE>
35. "Never a husband |
sought I to have,
Before the Gjukungs |
fared to our land;
Three were the kings |
on steeds that came,--
Need of their journey
| never there was.

<END PAGE>
36. "To the hero great
| my troth I gave
Who gold-decked sat |
on Grani's back;
Not like to thine | was
the light of his eyes,
(Nor like in form | and
face are ye,)
Though kingly both | ye
seemed to be.

<END PAGE>
37. "And so to me | did
Atli say
That share in our
wealth | I should not
have,
Of gold or lands, | if my
hand I gave not;
(More evil yet, | the
wealth I should yield,)
The gold that he | in my
childhood gave me,
<END PAGE>
(The wealth from him |
in my youth I had.)

38. "Oft in my mind | I
pondered much
If still I should fight, |
and warriors fell,
Brave in my byrnie, | my
brother defying;
That would wide | in the
world be known,
<END PAGE>
And sorrow for many |
a man would make.

39. "But the bond at
last | I let be made,
For more the hoard | I
longed to have,
The rings that the son
| of Sigmund won;
No other's treasure |
e'er I sought.
<END PAGE>
40. "One-alone | of all
I loved,
Nor changing heart | I
ever had;
All in the end | shall
Atli know,
When he hears I have
gone | on the
death-road hence."
* * * * * *

<END PAGE>
41. "Never a wife | of
fickle will
Yet to another | man
should yield.
. . . . . . . . . .
So vengence for all |
my ills shall come."
42, Up rose Gunnar, |
the people's ruler,
And flung his arms |
round her neck so
fair;
<END PAGE>
And all who came, | of
every kind,
Sought to hold her |
with all their hearts.

43. But back she cast |
all those who came,
Nor from the long road
| let them hold her;
In counsel then | did
he Hogni call:
<END PAGE>
Of wisdom now | full
great is our need.

44. Let the warriors
here | in the hall come
forth,
Thine and mine, | for
the need is mighty,
If haply the queen |
from death they may
hold,
<END PAGE>
Till her fearful
thoughts | with time
shall fade."

45. (Few the words | of
Hogni were:)
From the long road
now | shall ye hold her
not,
That born again | she
may never be!
<END PAGE>
Foul she came | from
her mother forth,
And born she was | for
wicked deeds,
(Sorrow to many | a
man to bring.)

46. From the speaker
gloomily | Gunnar
turned,
For the jewel-bearer |
her gems was dividing;
<END PAGE>
On all her wealth | her
eyes were gazing,
On the bond-women
slain | and the
slaughtered slaves.

47. Her byrnie of gold |
she donned, and grim
Was her heart ere the
point | of her sword
had pierced it;
<END PAGE>
On the pillow at last |
her head she laid,
And, wounded, her plan
| she pondered o'er.

48. "Hither I will | that
my women come
Who gold are fain |
from me to get;
Necklaces fashioned |
fair to each
<END PAGE>
Shall I give, and cloth, |
and garments bright."

49. Silent were all | as
so she spake,
And all together |
answer made:
Slain are enough; | we
seek to live,
Not thus thy women |
shall honor win.
<END PAGE>
50. Long the woman, |
linen-decked,
pondered,--
--Young she was,-- |
and weighed her words:
For my sake now | shall
none unwilling
Or loath to die | her
life lay down.

<END PAGE>
51. But little of gems |
to gleam on your limbs
Ye then shall find |
when forth ye fare
To follow me, | or of
Menja's wealth.
. . . . . . . . . .

52. "Sit now, Gunnar! |
for I shall speak
Of thy bride so fair |
and so fain to die;
<END PAGE>
Thy ship in harbor |
home thou hast not,
Although my life | I now
have lost.

53. "Thou shalt
Guthrun requite | more
quick than thou
thinkest,
. . . . . . . . . .
Though sadly mourns |
the maiden wise
<END PAGE>
Who dwells with the
king, | o'er her
husband dead.

54. "A maid shall then |
the mother bear;
Brighter far | than the
fairest day
Svanhild shall be, | or
the beams of the sun.

<END PAGE>
55. "Guthrun a noble |
husband thou givest,
Yet to many a warrior |
woe will she bring,
Not happily wedded |
she holds herself;
Her shall Atli | hither
seek,
(Buthli's son, | and
brother of mine.)

<END PAGE>
56. "Well I remember |
how me ye treated
When ye betrayed me |
with treacherous wiles;
. . . . . . . . . .
Lost was my joy | as
long as I lived.

57. "Oddrun as wife |
thou fain wouldst win,
But Atli this | from thee
withholds;
<END PAGE>
Yet in secret tryst | ye
twain shall love;
She shall hold thee
dear, | as I had done
If kindly fate | to us
had fallen.

58. "Ill to thee | shall
Atli bring,
When he casts thee
down | in the den of
snakes.
<END PAGE>
59. "But soon
thereafter | Atli too
His life, methinks, | as
thou shalt lose,
(His fortune lose | and
the lives of his sons;)
Him shall Guthrun, | grim
of heart,
With the biting blade | in
his bed destroy.

<END PAGE>
60. "It would better
beseem | thy sister
fair
To follow her husband
| first in death,
If counsel good | to
her were given,
Or a heart akin | to
mine she had.

<END PAGE>
61. "Slowly I speak,-- |
but for my sake
Her life, methinks, | she
shall not lose;
She shall wander over
| the tossing waves,
To where Jonak rules |
his father's realm.

<END PAGE>
62. "Sons to him | she
soon shall bear,
Heirs therewith | of
Jonak's wealth;
But Svanhild far | away
is sent,
The child she bore | to
Sigurth brave.

<END PAGE>
63. "Bikki's word | her
death shall be,
For dreadful the wrath
| of Jormunrek;
So slain is all | of
Sigurth's race,
And greater the woe |
of Guthrun grows.

<END PAGE>
64. "Yet one boon | I
beg of thee,
The last of boons | in
my life it is:
Let the pyre be built |
so broad in the field
That room for us all |
will ample be,
(For us who slain | with
Sigurth are.)

<END PAGE>
65. "With shields and
carpets | cover the
pyre,
. . . . . . . . . .
Shrouds full fair, | and
fallen slaves,
And besides the
Hunnish | hero burn me.

<END PAGE>
66. "Besides the
Hunnish | hero there
Slaves shall burn, | full
bravely decked,
Two at his head | and
two at his feet,
A brace of hounds |
and a pair of hawks,
For so shall all | be
seemly done.

<END PAGE>
67. "Let between us |
lie once more
The steel so keen, | as
so it lay
When both within | one
bed we were,
And wedded mates | by
men were called.

<END PAGE>
68. "The door of the
hall | shall strike not
the heel
Of the hero fair | with
flashing rings,
If hence my following |
goes with him;
Not mean our faring |
forth shall be.

<END PAGE>
69. "Bond-women five |
shall follow him,
And eight of my thralls,
| well-born are they,
Children with me, | and
mine they were
As gifts that Buthli | his
daughter gave.

<END PAGE>
