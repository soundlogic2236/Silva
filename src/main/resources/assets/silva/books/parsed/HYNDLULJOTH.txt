The Poem of Hyndla
<END PAGE>
1. "Maiden, awake! |
wake thee, my friend,
My sister Hyndla, | in
thy hollow cave!
Already comes
darkness, | and ride
must we
To Valhall to seek | the
sacred hall.

<END PAGE>
2. "The favor of
Heerfather | seek we
to find,
To his followers gold |
he gladly gives;
To Hermoth gave he |
helm and mail-coat,
And to Sigmund he gave
| a sword as gift.

<END PAGE>
3. "Triumph to some, |
and treasure to
others,
To many wisdom | and
skill in words,
Fair winds to the
sailor, | to the singer
his art,
And a manly heart | to
many a hero.

<END PAGE>
4. "Thor shall I honor,
| and this shall I ask,
That his favor true |
mayst thou ever find;
. . . . . . . . . .
Though little the brides
| of the giants he
loves.

<END PAGE>
5. "From the stall now |
one of thy wolves lead
forth,
And along with my boar
| shalt thou let him run;
For slow my boar goes
| on the road of the
gods,
And I would not weary |
my worthy steed."

<END PAGE>
Hyndla spake:
6. "Falsely thou askest
me, | Freyja, to go,
For so in the glance |
of thine eyes I see;
On the way of the slain
| thy lover goes with
thee.
Ottar the young, | the
son of Instein."

<END PAGE>
Freyja spake:
7. "Wild dreams,
methinks, | are thine
when thou sayest
My lover is with me | on
the way of the slain;
There shines the boar
| with bristles of gold,
Hildisvini, | he who was
made
By Dain and Nabbi, | the
cunning dwarfs.
<END PAGE>
8. "Now let us down |
from our saddles leap,
And talk of the race |
of the heroes twain;
The men who were born
| of the gods above,
. . . . . . . . . .

9. "A wager have made
| in the foreign metal
Ottar the young | and
Angantyr;
<END PAGE>
We must guard, for the
hero | young to have,
His father's wealth, |
the fruits of his race.

10. "For me a shrine |
of stones he made,--
And now to glass | the

beasts was it red;

In the goddesses ever
| did Ottar trust.

11. "Tell to me now |
the ancient names,
And the races of all |
that were born of old:
Who are of the
Skjoldungs, | who of
the Skilfings,
Who of the Othlings, |
who of the Ylfings,
<END PAGE>
Who are the
free-born, | who are
the high-born,
The noblest of men |
that in Mithgarth
dwell?"

| with bracelets fair,
Hight, methinks, | the

Frothi her father, |
and Friaut her
mother;--
<END PAGE>
Her race of the
mightiest | men must
seem.

14. "Of old the noblest

were carried.

Eymund, | the strongest
of men,
Sigtrygg he slew | with

And eighteen boys | did
Almveig bear him.

16. "Hence come the
Skjoldungs, | hence the
Skilfings,
Hence the Othlings, |
hence the Ynglings,
Hence come the
free-born, | hence the
high-born,
<END PAGE>
The noblest of men |

fool!

were born of old
The sons of Arngrim |

Like fire o'er land |
and sea they fared,
And all are thy
kinsmen, | Ottar, thou
fool!
<END PAGE>

fool!

30. Eleven in number |
the gods were known,
When Baldr o'er the hill
| of death was bowed;
And this to avenge |
was Vali swift,
When his brother's
slayer | soon he slew.

Baldr | was the heir of
Bur,
. . . . . . . . . .

The dark-loving giant; |
his daughter was
Skathi.

thee, | and further will
tell;
There is much that I
know;-- | wilt thou hear
yet more?

34. Heith and
Hrossthjof, | the
children of Hrimnir.
. . . . . . . . . .

35. The sybils arose |
from Vitholf's race,
From Vilmeith all | the
seers are,
And the workers of
charms | are
Svarthofthi's children,
<END PAGE>
And from Ymir sprang |
the giants all.

36. Much have I told
thee, | and further will
tell;
There is much that I
know;-- | wilt thou hear
yet more?

<END PAGE>
37. One there was born
| in the bygone days,
Of the race of the
gods, | and great was
his might;
Nine giant women, | at
the world's edge,
Once bore the man | so
mighty in arms.

<END PAGE>

him, | Greip there bore
him,
Eistla bore him, | and

42. The wolf did Loki |
with Angrbotha win,
And Sleipnir bore he |
to Svathilfari;
The worst of marvels |
seemed the one
That sprang from the
brother | of Byleist
then.

<END PAGE>
43. A heart ate Loki,--
| in the embers it lay,
And half-cooked found
he | the woman's
heart;--
With child from the
woman | Lopt soon was,
And thence among men |
came the monsters all.

<END PAGE>
44. The sea,
storm-driven, | seeks
heaven itself,
O'er the earth it flows,
| the air grows sterile;
Then follow the snows |
and the furious winds,
For the gods are
doomed, | and the end
is death.

<END PAGE>
45. Then comes
another, | a greater
than all,
Though never I dare |
his name to speak;
Few are they now | that
farther can see
Than the moment when
Othin | shall meet the
wolf.

Freyja spake:
46. "To my boar now
bring | the
memory-beer,
So that all thy words, |
that well thou hast
spoken,
The third morn hence |
he may hold in mind,
When their races Ottar
| and Angantyr tell."

Hyndla spake:
47. "Hence shalt thou
fare, | for fain would I

From me thou gettest |
few favors good;
My noble one, out | in
the night thou leapest
As. Heithrun goes | the
goats among.

48. "To Oth didst thou
run, | who loved thee
ever,
And many under | thy
apron have crawled;
My noble one, out | in
the night thou leapest,
As Heithrun goes | the
goats among."

Freyja spake:
49. "Around the
giantess | flames shall
I raise,
So that forth
unburned | thou mayst
not fare."

Hyndla spake:
50. "Flames I see
burning, | the earth is
on fire,
<END PAGE>
And each for his life |
the price must lose;
Bring then to Ottar |
the draught of beer,
Of venom full | for an
evil fate."

Freyja spake:
51. "Thine evil words |
shall work no ill,
Though, giantess, bitter
| thy baleful threats;
