FAFNISMOL
The Ballad of Fafnir
<END PAGE>
1. "Youth, oh, youth! |
of whom then, youth,
art thou born?
Say whose son thou
art,
Who in Fafnir's blood |
thy bright blade
reddened,
And struck thy sword
to my heart."
Sigurth concealed his
name because it was
believed in olden times
that the word of a
dying man might
<END PAGE>
have great power if he
cursed his foe by his
name. He said:

2. "The Noble Hart | my
name, and I go
A motherless man
abroad;
Father I had not, | as
others have,
And lonely ever I live."
<END PAGE>
Fafnir spake:
3. "If father thou
hadst not, | as others
have,
By what wonder wast
thou born?
(Though thy name on
the day | of my death
thou hidest,
Thou knowest now thou
dost lie.)"
<END PAGE>
Sigurth spake:
4. "My race, methinks, |
is unknown to thee,
And so am I myself;
Sigurth my name, | and
Sigmund's son,
Who smote thee thus
with the sword."

<END PAGE>
Fafnir spake:
5. "Who drove thee on?
| why wert thou driven
My life to make me
lose?
A father brave | had
the bright-eyed youth,
For bold in boyhood
thou art."

<END PAGE>
Sigurth spake:
6. "My heart did drive
me, | my hand fulfilled,
And my shining sword
so sharp;
Few are keen | when
old age comes,
Who timid in boyhood
be."

<END PAGE>
Fafnir spake:
7. "If thou mightest
grow | thy friends
among,
One might see thee
fiercely fight;
But bound thou art, |
and in battle taken,
And to fear are
prisoners prone."

<END PAGE>
Sigurth spake:
8. "Thou blamest me,
Fafnir, | that I see
from afar
The wealth that my
father's was;
Not bound am I, |
though in battle taken,
Thou hast found that
free I live."

<END PAGE>
Fafnir spake:
9. "In all I say | dost
thou hatred see,
Yet truth alone do I
tell;
The sounding gold, |
the glow-red wealth,
And the rings thy bane
shall be."

<END PAGE>
Sigurth spake:
10. "Some one the
hoard | shall ever
hold,
Till the destined day
shall come;
For a time there is |
when every man
Shall journey hence to
hell."

<END PAGE>
Fafnir spake:
11. "The fate of the
Norns | before the
headland
Thou findest, and doom
of a fool;
In the water shalt
drown | if thou row
'gainst the wind,
All danger is near to
death."
<END PAGE>
Sigurth spake:
12. "Tell me then,
Fafnir, | for wise thou
art famed,
And much thou knowest
now:
Who are the Norns |
who are helpful in
need,
And the babe from the
mother bring?"
<END PAGE>
Fafnir spake:
13. "Of many births |
the Norns must be,
Nor one in race they
were;
Some to gods, others |
to elves are kin,
And Dvalin's daughters
some."

<END PAGE>
Sigurth spake:
14. "Tell me then,
Fafnir, | for wise thou
art famed,
And much thou knowest
now:
How call they the isle |
where all the gods
And Surt shall
sword-sweat mingle?"

<END PAGE>
Fafnir spake:
15. "Oskopnir is it, |
where all the gods
Shall seek the play of
swords;
Bilrost breaks | when
they cross the bridge,
And the steeds shall
swim in the flood.

<END PAGE>
16. "The fear-helm I
wore | to afright
mankind,
While guarding my gold
I lay;
Mightier seemed I | than
any man,
For a fiercer never I
found."

<END PAGE>
Sigurth spake:
17. "The fear-helm
surely | no man shields
When he faces a
valiant foe;
Oft one finds, | when
the foe he meets,
That he is not the
bravest of all."

<END PAGE>
Fafnir spake:
18. "Venom I breathed |
when bright I lay
By the hoard my
father had;
(There was none so
mighty | as dared to
meet me,
And weapons nor wiles
I feared.)"

<END PAGE>
Sigurth spake:
19. "Glittering worm, |
thy hissing was great,
And hard didst show
thy heart;
But hatred more | have
the sons of men
For him who owns the
helm."

<END PAGE>
Fafnir spake:
20. "I counsel thee,
Sigurth, | heed my
speech,
And ride thou
homeward hence,
The sounding gold, |
the glow-red wealth,
And the rings thy bane
shall be."

<END PAGE>
Sigurth spake:
21. "Thy counsel is
given, | but go I shall
To the gold in the
heather hidden;
And, Fafnir, thou | with
death dost fight,
Lying where Hel shall
have thee."

<END PAGE>
Fafnir spake:
22. "Regin betrayed me,
| and thee will betray,
Us both to death will he
bring;
His life, methinks, | must
Fafnir lose,
For the mightier man
wast thou."
Regin had gone to a
distance while Sigurth
fought Fafnir, and
came back while Sigurth
was wiping the
<END PAGE>
blood from his sword.
Regin said:

23. "Hail to thee,
Sigurth! | Thou victory
hast,
And Fafnir in fight hast
slain;
Of all the men | who
tread the earth,
Most fearless art thou,
methinks."
<END PAGE>
Sigurth spake:
24. "Unknown it is, |
when all are together,
(The sons of the
glorious gods,)
Who bravest born shall
seem;
Some are valiant | who
redden no sword
In the blood of a
foeman's breast."
<END PAGE>
Regin spake:
25. "Glad art thou,
Sigurth, | of battle
gained,
As Gram with grass
thou cleansest;
My brother fierce | in
fight hast slain,
And somewhat I did
myself."

<END PAGE>
Sigurth spake:
26. "Afar didst thou go
| while Fafnir reddened
With his blood my blade
so keen;
With the might of the
dragon | my strength I
matched,
While thou in the
heather didst hide."

<END PAGE>
Regin spake:
27. "Longer wouldst
thou | in the heather
have let
Yon hoary giant hide,
Had the weapon availed
not | that once I
forged,
The keen-edged blade
thou didst bear."

<END PAGE>
Sigurth spake:
28. "Better is heart |
than a mighty blade
For him who shall
fiercely fight;
The brave man well |
shall fight and win,
Though dull his blade
may be.

<END PAGE>
29. "Brave men better |
than cowards be,
When the clash of
battle comes;
And better the glad |
than the gloomy man
Shall face what before
him lies.

<END PAGE>
30. "Thy rede it was |
that I should ride
Hither o'er mountains
high;
The glittering worm |
would have wealth and
life
If thou hadst not
mocked at my might."
Then Regin went up to
Fafnir and cut out his
heart with his sword,
that was named Rithil,
and then he
<END PAGE>
drank blood from the
wounds. Regin said:

31. "Sit now, Sigurth, |
for sleep will I,
Hold Fafnir's heart to
the fire;
For all his heart | shall
eaten be,
Since deep of blood I
have drunk."
<END PAGE>
Sigurth took Fafnir's
heart and cooked it on
a spit. When he thought
that it was fully
cooked, and the
blood foamed out of
the heart, then he
tried it with his finger
to see whether it was
fully cooked. He
burned his finger, and
put it in his mouth. But
when Fafnir's
heart's-blood came on
his tongue, he
<END PAGE>
understood the speech
of birds. He heard
nut-hatches chattering
in the thickets. A nut
hatch said:

32. "There sits Sigurth,
| sprinkled with blood,
And Fafnir's heart |
with fire he cooks;
Wise were the breaker
| of rings, I ween,
<END PAGE>
To eat the life-muscles
| all so bright."

A second spake:
33. "There Regin lies, |
and plans he lays
The youth to betray |
who trusts him well;
Lying words | with wiles
will he speak,
Till his brother the
maker | of mischief
avenges."
<END PAGE>
A third spake:
34. "Less by a head |
let the chatterer
hoary
Go from here to hell;
Then all of the wealth |
he alone can wield,
The gold that Fafnir
guarded."

<END PAGE>
A fourth spake:
35. "Wise would he seem
| if so he would heed
The counsel good | we
sisters give;
Thought he would give,
| and the ravens
gladden,
There is ever a wolf |
where his ears I spy."

<END PAGE>
A fifth spake:
36. "Less wise must be
| the tree of battle
Than to me would seem
| the leader of men,
If forth he lets | one
brother fare,
When he of the other |
the slayer is."

<END PAGE>
A sixth spake:
37. "Most foolish he
seems | if he shall
spare
His foe, the bane of
the folk,
There Regin lies, | who
hath wronged him so,
Yet falsehood knows
he not."

<END PAGE>
A seventh spake:
38. "Let the head from
the frost-cold | giant
be hewed,
And let him of rings be
robbed;
Then all the wealth |
which Fafnir's was
Shall belong to thee
alone."

<END PAGE>
Sigurth spake:
39. "Not so rich a fate
| shall Regin have
As the tale of my death
to tell;
For soon the brothers
| both shall die,
And hence to hell shall
go."
Sigurth hewed off
Regin's head, and then
he ate Fafnir's heart,
and drank the blood of
both Regin and
<END PAGE>
Fafnir. Then Sigurth
heard what the
nut-hatch said:

40. "Bind, Sigurth, the
golden | rings
together,
Not kingly is it | aught
to fear;
I know a maid, | there is
none so fair,
<END PAGE>
Rich in gold, | if thou
mightest get her.

41. "Green the paths |
that to Gjuki lead,
And his fate the way |
to the wanderer shows;
The doughty king | a
daughter has,
That thou as a bride |
mayst, Sigurth, buy."
<END PAGE>
Another spake:
42. "A hall stands high
| on Hindarfjoll,
All with flame | is it
ringed without;
Warriors wise | did
make it once
Out of the flaming |
light of the flood.

<END PAGE>
43. "On the mountain
sleeps | a battle-maid,
And about her plays |
the bane of the wood;
Ygg with the thorn |
hath smitten her thus,
For she felled the
fighter | he fain would
save.

<END PAGE>
44. "There mayst thou
behold | the maiden
helmed,
Who forth on
Vingskornir | rode from
the fight;
The victory-bringer |
her sleep shall break
not,
Thou heroes' son, | so
the Norns have set."
<END PAGE>
Sigurth rode along
Fafnir's trail to his
lair, and found it open.
The gate-posts were
of iron, and the gates;
of iron, too, were all
the beams in the house,
which was dug down
into the earth. There
Sigurth found a
mighty store of gold,
and he filled two
chests full thereof; he
took the fear-helm and
a golden mail-coat
